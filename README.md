### Install ETCD

- Unzip to directory：dockin-etcd
- Default deployment path：/data/app/dockin-etcd
- Certificate generation path：/data/app/dockin-etcd/conf
- Configuration file：conf/install.properties
- Default port：5379

- Configuration file：none
- Install Command

```
cd dockin-docker
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Install WORKER

> Note 1: The WORKER component needs to be installed on both the Master node and the Worker node. For the Worker component installed on the Master node, the token and master parameters do not need to be filled in.

> Note 2: If there is no vip, you can directly fill in the server IP, the same below

- Unzip to directory：dockin-worker
- Configuration file：conf/install.properties

```
ip=[@HOSTIP]

# Token added to the cluster, generated by the master script
token=[#join-token]

# Master ApiServer IP/VIP
master=[#master-vip]
```

- Install Command

```
cd dockin-worker
# If the non-master node master_node parameter needs to be changed to false
sudo ./install.sh install v1.16.6 master_node=true

```


### Install K8S Master

- Unzip to directory：dockin-master
- Configuration file：conf/install.properties

```
# master HA VIP
master_vip=[#MASTER_VIP]

# masterIP and VIP
master_ip_list=[#MASTER_IP_LIST]

# local IP
local_ip=[@HOSTIP]

# etcd list, eg: https://ip1:port1,https://ip2:port2,https://ip3:port3; 
# Please note that the port of dockin-etcd is 5379
etcd_list=[#ETCD_LIST]
```

- ETCD Certificate path：/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/

```
# Need to include the following files, obtained from the ETCD node /data/app/dockin-etcd/conf path
ca.pem client.pem client-key.pem
```

- Install Command

```
cd dockin-master
# If it is not the first node, please set first_node to false
sudo ./install.sh install v1.16.6 first_node=true
```

### Use an external load balancer

Use the LB provided by cloud vendors, self-built haproxy, and self-built nginx to access apiserver as a highly available load balancer
